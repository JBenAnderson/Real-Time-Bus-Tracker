# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

Using geo-location data from MIT bus routing and api from Mapbox you can create an application that updates bus location data and displays the data in a 3-D map for the user.

## Installation

1.  Download all files to a folder.
2.  You must add your own mapbox api key to the top of mapanimation.js file. This can easily be done for free at mapbox.com and creating a developer profile and generating a new key.
3.  Open index.html with your favorite browser.

## Usage

App updates every 7 seconds to display bus data. Users can pinch and zoom map to their liking.

## Roadmap

  **Updated 7/30**
  -fullscreen fluid window for better viewing and resizing.
  -zoom defaults fixed.
  -added popup returning the name of each bus enroute.
  -increased accuracy with lower fixed interval.
